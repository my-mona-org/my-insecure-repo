# Dependabot Burner (with Projects)

- Add all open Dependabot PRs to the project board under “Todo”.
- Create bundle issues grouped by runtime + manifest (max 5 PRs each, security separate, no duplicates).
- Explain the grouping briefly and list PRs in merge order (patch/minor → major).
- Add bundle issues to the project board under “Review Required”. 
- Post a status update with PR counts: open, merged/closed since last update, remaining.
